## A note before you contribute
Please take note that your commit will benefit me and whoever else is working on this repo. I can't be the only one working on this website. You, too, can contribute to the hard work that I have put into this repo by adding a commit.
Note that your commit may affect the website in terms of design, loading and scripting. Therefore, you should fork [this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to help me make this project last.
Without your support, this would not be possible. Anyways, enough of the yabba gabba. On to the docs!
## Another important thing
Sorry about this, but I am officially depreceating this repo in favour of the v2 of the site, available [here](https://githubpageschan4077.firebaseapp.com) and the source code [here](https://github.com/Chan4077/githubpageschan4077). PRs and issues will be marked with the [`rejected`](https://github.com/Chan4077/chan4077.github.io/issues?q=label%3Arejected+is%3Aclosed) label except for issue [#34](https://github.com/Chan4077/chan4077.github.io/issues/34).
